This file is the one I'll use to test out commits.
To begin with, I'm adding few lines in this text file.
Let's do the first commit.

Once the first commit went in, I am planning to make some more changes as this line indicates.
With more such changes, I shall be ready fro my first release.
Let's do a commit first and then move forward to release the version 1.0.0.
