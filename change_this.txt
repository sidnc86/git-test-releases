This file is the one I'll use to test out commits.
To begin with, I'm adding few lines in this text file.
Let's do the first commit.

Once the first commit went in, I am planning to make some more changes as this line indicates.
With more such changes, I shall be ready fro my first release.
Let's do a commit first and then move forward to release the version 1.0.0.

Now that version 1.0.0 has been released, I'm now making more commits introducing some new features and patch fixes  to current product code base.
Let's commit these patches and features together for now.
Let's target them to be released as part of Version 1.1.0

As part of feature, let's also introduce a new file by name one_more.txt.
Let's commit these changes and that file together.
